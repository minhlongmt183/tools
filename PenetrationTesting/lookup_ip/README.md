# IP Lookup

This Go program performs IP lookup for a list of domains and saves the unique IP addresses to a file.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Go installed on your machine.

2. Clone the repository or copy the `main.go` file to your local environment.

3. Create a file named `domains.txt` and add the list of domains you want to perform IP lookup for, with each domain on a new line.

4. Run the program using the following command:

   ```shell
   go run main.go domains.txt
Replace domains.txt with the actual path to your domain file.

The program will perform IP lookup for each domain, save the unique IP addresses to ip.txt, and display a completion message.
